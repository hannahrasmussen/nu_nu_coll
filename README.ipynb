    "This code models neutrino-neutrino collisions in the early universe. It is run in ``basic_code.py`` (see https://github.com/hannahrasmussen/BasicCode). To make a ``nu_nu_coll`` package, execute the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the directory that your BasicCode folder is in. Make a folder there called ``nu_nu_coll``, then make a folder within ``nu_nu_coll`` that is also named ``nu_nu_coll``.\n",
    "2. Download ``nu_nu_collisions.py`` from my GitHub page at https://github.com/hannahrasmussen/nu_nu_coll (you've probably already done that if you're reading this) and put it in the folder within the folder.\n",
    "3. In the folder (not the folder within the folder), put a ``setup.py`` folder with the following code:\n",
    "        from setuptools import setup\n",
    "        setup(name='nu_nu_coll',\n",
    "          version='0.1',\n",
    "          description='Neutrino-neutrino collision code',\n",
    "          url='https://github.com/hannahrasmussen/nu_nu_coll',\n",
    "          author='Hannah Rasmussen',\n",
    "          author_email='hannahrasmussen17@gmail.com',\n",
    "          license='MIT',\n",
    "          packages=['nu_nu_coll'],\n",
    "          zip_safe=False)\n",
    "          \n",
    "4. Now, go to the terminal and checkout your new folder (not the folder within a folder) using the ‘cd’ command. \n",
    "5. Once you’re there, type and enter ‘pip install -e .’ (including the period). That ‘-e’ extension means that updates you make to the code are automatically also installed, which is obviously what we want.\n",
    "6. Now, to see if it worked, open a separate jupyter notebook kernel and try and do ‘from nu_nu_coll import nu_nu_collisions’. If there are no errors, you can delete that line and should be good to run the code as is."
